AIM- It is a spam detection model in which we need to identify whether a particular mail is spam or not

Steps:

1. Import pandas
2. Import the file in which dataset is given
3. Use 1 to detect spam and 0 to detect ham(since scikit deals only with numerical data)
4. Introducing bag of words concept- Take a piece of text and count the frequency of a given word
5. To handle this we need a counnt tokenizer which tokenizes the string and given an integer id to each token and counts its occurance. Procedure:
	5.1: Converting all strings to their lower case form
	5.2: Removing all punctuations
	5.3: Tokenization
	5.4: Counting frequencies
6. Implementing bag of words using scikit-learn(Count Vectorizer which is the same thing one we did above)	
7. Training and testing sets
	7.1: Split dataset into training and testing set by using train_test_split method in sklearn
	7.2: X_train for sms_message column(training)
	7.3: y_train for label column(training)
	7.4: X_test for sms_message(testing)
	7.5: y_test for label(testing)
7. Applying bag of words processing
8. Bayes theorem and its implementation
